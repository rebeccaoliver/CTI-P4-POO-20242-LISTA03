# **Java Programming Solutions and Fundamentals of Modularization**

This repository contains solutions to a series of programming problems in Java. Each problem is presented with a brief description of its functionality, along with a direct link to the corresponding code.

This chapter focuses on **modularization** through the use of **subroutines**, an essential concept in programming that promotes code reusability, readability, and maintainability. It introduces two main types of subroutines: **functions**, which return values after performing a specific task, and **procedures (methods)**, which perform actions without returning a value. The chapter explains how to define, call, and organize subroutines, emphasizing the use of **parameters** for passing data and **return statements** for producing results.

### 3. **Create a program with a subroutine that receives three integers a, b, and c, where a is greater than 1. The subroutine should sum all integers between b and c that are divisible by a (including b and c) and return the result to be printed.**  âž•

### 4. **Create a subroutine that receives a single value representing seconds. The subroutine should convert it into hours, minutes, and seconds. All variables should be passed as parameters, with no global variables.** âž•

### 7. **Create a program with a subroutine that receives the three grades of a student as parameters and a letter. If the letter is A, the subroutine should calculate the arithmetic average of the grades; if it's P, it should calculate the weighted average with weights 5, 3, and 2. The calculated average should be returned to the main program and displayed.**  âž•

### 8. **Create a subroutine that receives the start and end time of a game, both subdivided into hours and minutes. The subroutine should return the duration in minutes, considering the maximum duration of a game is 24 hours, and it may start on one day and end on another.**  âž•
